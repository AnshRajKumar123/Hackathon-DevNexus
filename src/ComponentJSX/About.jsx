                    <p>Discover the passion and technology behind our mission to eliminate parking stress. What started as a simple idea to solve <br /> city congestion has evolved into a seamless digital platform.</p>

                        <h1>Our Journey</h1>
                        <p>The foundation of <b>Parkly</b> emerged from a real-life frustration shared by a close friend, <b>Ranjit Maurya</b>. While heading to a crucial career interview, Ranjit found himself trapped in a nightmare: despite arriving in the area on time, he spent over thirty minutes circling for parking. By the time he found a spot, he was significantly late for his interview. Seeing a friend suffer such a high-stakes setback due to a simple parking issue sparked a mission: <b>no one should ever miss an opportunity because of a parking spot</b>.</p>
                        <p>While other platforms exist, we noticed they lacked the speed and precision required for the modern driver. This drove our team to build something better. We integrated a <b>live-map interface</b> with <b>real-time GPS tracking</b> to ensure users aren't just finding a general area, but a specific, available slot.</p>
                        <p>To streamline the experience, we pioneered a <b>seamless QR-code entry system</b>. Upon booking, users receive an instant digital pass; a simple scan at the facility allows them to park and go without touching a ticket or waiting in a queue. Combined with our <b>24/7 dedicated customer support</b>, Parkly isn't just a booking site—it's a commitment to ensuring that your journey ends exactly when you arrive.</p>
